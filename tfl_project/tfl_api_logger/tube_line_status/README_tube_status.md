This sub-package is depreciated, but left in the repository for completeness. 

Tube status data (e.g. around line disruptions) was logged during the project as a possible avenue of exploration. 
Ultimately it was not used in the report, and the `bikeStationStatus` module became far more important. 

A big part of this module was also the ability to log data to a Google Sheet via their API. 
This worked, but due to size limitations I just switched to logging to CSV for later logging.
