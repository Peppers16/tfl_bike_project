Pickled cities are large: around 50MB

For this reason I have only committed one to version control: london_big_warehouse
 
This city can be used for demonstration as a "here's one I made earlier" without having all prequisite data prepared.

To use this city, you can run any of the following scripts in python (run whilst the interpreter active directory is 
tfl_project):
* simulation/scenario_scripts/sim1_warehouses_bigger_5am.py
* simulation/scenario_scripts/sim2.1_WH_and_ideal_allocation.py
* simulation/scenario_scripts/sim2.2_WH_typeBalloc.py
* simulation/scenario_scripts/sim3_WH_squeezed_typeCalloc.py
